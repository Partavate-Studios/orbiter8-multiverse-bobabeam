# Orbiter 8 Multiverse Demo

[This demo](https://demos.partavate.com/o8-multiverse-bobabeam) is a proof of concept for [Orbiter 8](https://orbiter8.com)'s multiverse mechanics.

[Partavate Studios](https://partavate.com) created this demo
as a submission for the
[Bobabeam hackathon](https://bobaxmoonbeam.notion.site/bobaxmoonbeam/BOBA-x-MOONBEAM-HACK-CHALLENGE-264b16c0ea2b4878b7c03a708df7653d).
Special thanks to [Boba Network](https://boba.network/) and [Moonbeam Network](https://moonbeam.network/) for the opportunity to buidl fun things.

## Orbiter 8?

Orbiter 8 is a space trading MMO designed to run entirely on a distributed ledger network. Being fully decentralized in this way, the game is client agnostic allowing anyone to build a new client that will interface with the same game. Game assets have token interfaces allowing ships and planets to be traded as ERC721 NFTs and the in-game galactic credits to be traded as ERC20 tokens. The game world, a directed network of stars, is near-infinite and dynamically generated as players explore the frontier. The game is designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and can be deployed to most EVM compatible networks.

## Multiverse Mechanics?

Orbiter 8 is a multi-chain application, with unique instances of the game universe running on multiple distributed ledger networks. This is the multiverse - and the multiverse is connected. Gamers will be able to fly their ships through portals to another universe - or, in other words, bridge their ship NFT to another network.

## What's it do?

This demo contains two key sections. The first is a basic story animation to establish the context of the game world. The second section demostrates the
transfer of a ship NFT between the Moonbase and Bobabase networks initiated by flying an Orbiter 8 ship into a portal.
